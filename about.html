                            <h3><b>About me</b></h3>

                            <p>My name is Adi Barbu, I'm from Romania, and I'm a web designer and a software developer. This website contains a collection of programs and tools that I have created. The entire website and the SOFTWARE that exists within
                                are designed, developed and updated by me. They are offered free of charge and are usually developed after my own needs and interests, but you will probably find them useful also.</p>

                            <p>I'm also a content writer on my own blog in Romanian (adibarbu.ro), where I write articles and tutorial about computers, tech, Internet, software, blogging and other topics.</p>
<br/>
                            <h3><b>About this site</b></h3>

                            <p>This website is a public software collection and also my portfolio. The maintenance and the software development for improving the existing software or to create new programs is made in my free time, therefore the process is
                                quite slow. If you like my work and you would like to support it, you can make donations and contributions which will speed up the software development.</p>

                            <p>The purpose of this website is to provide all the information you need in order to use and understand the available software and, of course, to serve as a source for downloading the software.</p>

                            <p>My native language is not English, so some language mistakes surely exists. If you find any mistakes you can also give help and report them (using the contact page), in this way I can improve the quality of the website.</p>

<br/>
                            <h3><b>About the software</b></h3>

                            <p>Whenever I create programs or tools that are doing tasks that help me in my needs and activities or simply I create software which is needed by others or that I consider that will be useful and popular, I publish them here,
                                so it can become accessible for anyone.</p>

                            <p>If you like the software that exists on this website, you can contribute to its development and utility by making translations into other languages, report bugs and suggest improvements. You can also share the news about the utility of them with your
                                friends on social networks such as Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter and others, or on your own website, which will boost the software popularity.</p>

                            <h3><b>About software security and safety</b></h3>

                            <p>The software from this site is clean of any viruses or any form of malware that you can think of, as long as you download it from this site (and other official pages on external sites, such as Sourceforge, Softpedia and others, which belongs to me). As a way to validate the safety of the available software, whenever I make updates or I publish a new program, I check it first with my local antivirus (currently Bitdefender) and I make a general virus scan online, using VirusTotal.</p>

                            <p>The thing that I had observed is that some of the antiviruses from VirusTotal.com shows that my software is infected with some sort of malware, but they are not major companies such as Bitdefener, Norton, AVG, Kaspersky, Avira, Panda, etc. but rather unpopular antiviruses. Those are so called false pozitive issues, and they shouldn't be a reason of concern. All of those messages and alerts about my software are simply wrong, being a result of an unreliable mechanism of detecting viruses or malware behavior, in general.</p>
